# Ayurveda Clinic — Homepage

This small project contains a responsive static homepage for an Ayurveda clinic.

Files:
- `index.php` — main homepage (mostly static HTML with tiny PHP for the year).
- `css/style.css` — responsive styles and layout.

How to run locally (Windows + XAMPP):
1. Place this folder under your `htdocs` (already at `c:\xampp\htdocs\project1`).
2. Start Apache from the XAMPP control panel.
3. Open http://localhost/project1/ in your browser.

Customization:
- Change clinic name, contact details, and testimonials directly in `index.php`.
- Replace the `logo` box with an image if you have one, for example: `<img src="images/logo.png" alt="logo">` and adjust styles.

Next steps (optional):
- Integrate a real booking form or third-party scheduler.
- Add images, icons, and accessibility improvements.
- Add basic JS for animations or a carousel for testimonials.
