            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Sikhar Ayurveda Clinic began as a small healing space founded by practitioners devoted to restoring traditional Ayurvedic practice in a supportive, modern setting. What started as a neighborhood consultation room has grown into a warm clinic where families come for deep healing, personalized care, and trustworthy guidance. Over the years, we have combined classical texts, carefully prepared herbal medicines, and hands-on therapies to bring tangible results for people with chronic conditions, stress-related disorders, and those simply seeking a balanced life.</p>
